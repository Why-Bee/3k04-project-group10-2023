Assignment1:
- Issues on GitHub.

Assignment2:
- Expand the DCM to include all required modes and parameters:
        - Off, VOOR, AOOR, VVIR, AAIR, VOO, AOO, VVI, AAI -> Done EXCEPT rate adaptive params

- Implement stable serial communication to transmit and receive information between the DCM and pacemaker.

- The system will be able to set, store, and transmit programmable parameter data -> Done EXCEPT for transmit
        - Verify it is stored correctly on the Pacemaker device

- The system will be able to display egram data when the user chooses to do so (for either ventricle, atrium, or both).
        - The DCM must receive the egram data from the Pacemaker over serial communication link in order to display it.

- Document how programmable parameters originate at the DCM and are implemented in the device. Show how you can ensure the parameters stored in the Pacemaker are what the doctor input on the DCM. Justify your choice of the data types used to represent the parameters data.


Landing Page Redesign: -> Redesign done, NEED input validation!
- the connect button would toggle between connect / disconnect opposite of what the device currently is -> Done
        - toggleConnectionStatus() would toggle icon top right and the button text -> Done
        - rename connection variable -> Done
- Loop through each param checking if in mode and either setting to val & showing edit button OR set to -- and hide their edit buttons -> Done
- instead of having all these big edit(mode) functions we just need one for each param -> Done
        - we alr have functions set up to update the labels and the mode -> Done
- implement edit param button functionality, should validate input then update label -> Done
        - Need input validation still


Admin Page: -> Done
- Be a "list" of patients -> Done
- Grab data from data base loop through it creating an instance of a "row" for each patient -> Done
- In each patients row display patient id, username, notes about patient, and option to remove from database -> Done
        - Need to add Notes column to database -> Done
        - Need to update database when column edited, on enter hit after typing finished -> Done
- Have popup on removal to ensure confirmation -> Done


Database:
- Need to have database with unique values per user <- Done
- Each user needs to have all programmable parameters <- Done
- Each mode needs unique programmable parameters. -> Done
- Need to be able to save and load database to/from file -> Done
